Sanket has a string consisting of only 'a' and 'b' as the characters.
Sanket describes perfectness of a string as the maximum length substring of equal characters.
Sanket is given a number k which denotes the maximum number of characters he can change.
Find the maximum perfectness he can generate by changing no more than k characters.

Input Format:
The first line contains an integer denoting the value of K. The next line contains a string having only ‘a’ and ‘b’ as the characters.

Constraints:
2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5

Output Format
A single integer denoting the maximum perfectness achievable.

Sample Input
