BROKEN CALCULATOR
Andrew was attempting a mathematics test where he needed to solve problems with factorials. One such problem had an answer which equaled 100! ,
He wondered what would this number look like. He tried to calculate 100! On his scientific calculator but failed to get a correct answer.
Can you write a code to help Andrew calculate factorials of such large numbers?

Input Format:

Constraints:
1 < = N < = 500

Output Format
Print the factorial of N

Sample Input
5
Sample Output
120
